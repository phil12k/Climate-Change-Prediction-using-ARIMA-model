# Climate-Change-Prediction-using-ARIMA-model
The project uses an ARIMA model which is a type of regression model to forecast the future
climate and predict the same.ARIMA is a combination of both AR (Auto regressions) and
MA (Moving average). Where AR uses its previous predicted values to forecast the new set
of values and MA uses the error in the predicted values to predict the next set of values.


The objective of our work is as follows.
1)Why do countries undergo climate attacks and where are their attacks based ? To find factors like
temperature change ,change in earth plates etc.. that influence these attacks Through this we’ll try
to figure out the characteristics of climatic changes.

2)An case study of the various climate attacks taking place in India.Which factors are responsible
for these and why certain areas are targeted? To predict future attacks.

3)Predict which country is most likely to be attacked by climate and through how ?This kind of
analysis will help different defence agencies to be well prepared and equipped for any future
climate attacks.

4)Our final objective is to build the regression model (ARIMA) for climate change and do it’s
forecasting
